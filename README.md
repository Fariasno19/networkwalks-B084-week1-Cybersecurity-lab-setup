## Cybersecurity Lab Setup

**Project Overview**

---
In this project, it focuses on setting a virtual lab with Kali Linux using Oracle VirtualBox.

The purpose of this lab to create a controlled environment where cybersecurity tools, network scanning, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and other security-testing activities can be performed safely and repeatedly.

The lab is set up on a private virtual network; in order to prepare for future additions of machines and their use as targets for authorized security testing.

---

## Objectives / Tasks to complete

- Install and configure VirtualBox.
- Install/import Kali Linux as a virtual machine.
- Create a private **NAT Network** for the cybersecurity lab.
- Configure network connectivity for Kali Linux.
- Assign a consistent IP address to the Kali VM.
- Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution.
- Take a clean VM snapshot for recovery.
- Document the complete setup process.
- Prepare the environment for future cybersecurity projects.

## Purpose of the Lab

The purpose of this lab offers a safe, regulated setting for authorized security testing and cybersecurity training.

It can be used for activities such as:

- Network reconnaissance
- Port scanning
- Vulnerability assessment
- Packet analysis
- Web security testing
- Exploitation practice
- Security-tool experimentation

  **Important:** This laboratory must only be used for systems that you own or have explicit permission to test. Do not use the lab or its tools to attack unauthorized systems.

 Lab Setup Procedure

## Step 1. Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.

**Tool:** 7-Zip

---

## Step 2. Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox was installed as the hypervisor.

---

## Step 3. Create the NAT Network

A dedicated NAT Network was created in VirtualBox.

Configuration:
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled

A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.

This will allow future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.


---

## Step 4. Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
```

The VM was allocated:

```text
RAM: 2048 MB
```
A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.



---

## Step 5. Configure the Kali Linux Network

The Kali Linux network configuration was checked and configured with a consistent IPv4 address.

Example configuration:

```text
IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
```

A consistent IP address makes it easier to document the lab and reference the Kali machine in future practices.

---

## Step 6. Create a Clean VM Snapshot

After completing the initial configuration, a VirtualBox snapshot was created.

Example snapshot name:

```text
Clean Kali - Network Setup
```

The snapshot represents the clean baseline of the laboratory.

If a future practice changes or damages the VM configuration, the machine can be restored to this baseline.

#  Problems Encountered & Solutions

Documenting problems is an important part of the project.

## Problem 1. Internet Connectivity After Static IP Configuration

After manually configuring the IPv4 settings, Internet connectivity may fail depending on the Kali/NetworkManager configuration.

One workaround used during this lab was:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dad-timeout 0
```

The network connection was then restarted/rebooted and connectivity was tested again.

> **Important:** Network interface and connection names may differ between systems. Students should first identify their actual connection name before running an `nmcli` command.

---

## Problem 2. Getting the VM to read the proper .iso file for the Machine to work

After downloading the.zip file and extracting with 7zip, oracle VirtualBox did not read the file properly which led to me to reinstall and extract after the file worked properly and my VM was able to run.

---

## What I learned


Through this project, I learned how to create and configure a virtual environment for cybersecurity practice.

The most important concepts I learned include:

### 1. NAT vs NAT Network

A standard NAT configuration and a NAT Network serve different purposes.

A NAT Network allows multiple VMs connected to the same virtual network to communicate with one another while providing network address translation for external connectivity.

This makes it useful for building a multi-machine cybersecurity laboratory.

### 2. Virtual Machine Networking

I learned how VirtualBox virtual network adapters connect virtual machines to different types of networks and how network configuration affects communication between machines.

### 3. Static IP Configuration

I learned how to configure and verify IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS settings in Kali Linux.
